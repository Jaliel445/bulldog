# bulldog


      In bulldog, I will discuss only one thing, people who bulldog, or lie to, other people.

My older brother lives in a nursing facility in Lima, Ohio called Care Core. I've never been there, but I've heardsome gross things about the place. For one, he said the food tasted like it was taken out of the garbage.
Another thing is his bathroom situation. He has to share it with another room as well as the staff. That's
just nasty. Furthermore, his shower is a communal one. He said it has black mold in it and is never cleaned.
I,m getting ready to look up what diseases black mold causes. And one of his nurses told him that the mold wasn't
as bad as it was put up to be. Even the state tried to close them down, under a different name which was Lima
Rehab And Nursing.
